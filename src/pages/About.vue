      <p class="px-4">
        CourseRoad is a student-run academic planner for MIT students. It allows
        students to plan out their degrees, test out paths for different majors,
        and view class information. CourseRoad is integrated with FireRoad, so
        you can download the FireRoad app to plan your degree on the go!

      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <div class="px-4">
        <ul style="display: inline-block">
          <li>
            <h3>Class year</h3>
            <p>
              Yeah, changing your class year is really unintuitive right now,
              sorry about that. The way to do it now is to click on a year
              number (e.g. "2021").
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Slow page load</h3>
            <p>
              We haven't done much optimization for loading time yet, but we
              recognize that it's annoying an are working on it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Slow drag and drop</h3>
            <p>
              There's a noticable delay between dragging and dropping a subject
              and the page updating and letting you do things again.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Scrolling while dragging</h3>
            <p>
              The semester view does not scroll adaptively when you are dragging
              classes into it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Open search on click</h3>
            <p>
              The search bar sometimes fails to open when clicked on. This seems
              to be computer/browser-dependent, and we are investigating. It
              should open when you start typing to search for a class.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Degree audit</h3>
            <p>
              It's never going to be perfect, because the audit is presented in
              English, which allows unlimited flexibility and annoying edge
              cases. However, we should be able to handle most normal use cases
              so be sure to submit mistakes through the
              <a target="_blank" href="https://fireroad.mit.edu/requirements/">
                requirements editor </a
              >. We're also working on handling petitions and overrides for the
              audit, which we know is important for a lot of people.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Responsiveness on mobile devices</h3>
            <p>
              CourseRoad is intended for non-mobile screen sizes. If you want to
              use a similar tool on your phone, check out the FireRoad app (see
              below).

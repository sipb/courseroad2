# Installation
TODO: do a practice install from scratch and make this section better.

`npm install` in the base directory should 'just work' (might need to prepend `sudo ` if your npm environment is messy like mine).

If that doesn't work... just do `npm install <package> --save-dev` for every package mentioned in error messages until it works (have to run command below).

# Running
`npm run dev` then go to <http://localhost:8080/>.

# Publishing

How to push changes to the live site:
run ./deploy.sh [dev or prod] [kerberos]

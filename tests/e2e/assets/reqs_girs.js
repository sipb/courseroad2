Every candidate for a bachelor's degree must have completed a minimum of eight subjects in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including distribution and concentration components. Subjects must be taken for a letter grade and students may not use their junior-senior P/D/F option. Two HASS subjects that are designated Communication Intensive may also be used toward the Communication Requirement.\n\nDistribution. Three of the eight subjects must be selected from designated categories: humanities, arts, and social sciences. The three subjects may be taken at any stage of the student's undergraduate career, although students are encouraged to complete their distribution by the end of their junior year. Over 600 subjects may be used to fulfill this requirement. For a complete list of the subjects in each category, consult the Subjects.\n\nConcentration. Each student should designate a field of concentration, in consultation with a designated advisor in the field, by submitting a Concentration Proposal Form no later than the end of the first week of classes in the second term of junior year. Concentration requirements are set by each field and consist of either three or four subjects. One of the subjects that counts toward the distribution may also be designated as a concentration subject with the permission of the concentration advisor. Upon completion of all of the subjects noted on the Proposal Form, each student should submit a Concentration Completion Form no later than the end of the first week of classes of the final term prior to graduation. For more information, visit the HASS Requirement website."
